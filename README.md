Taking this course at my college has made me appreciate the nuance, and the sheer complexity this branch of engineering has to offer. Browsing linkedin, I came across a post saying, the best way to learn CFD is to do CFD. Here, I will primarily use MATLAB, as that is what I'm most comfortable with, and also offers brilliant execution as a Live Script.

This series of fundamental CFD programs will cover (by finite volume methods):
1. Laminar Steady State flows (Finite Volume)
2. Laminar Transient (eg. vortex shedding)
3. Steady State 1D heat conduction (walls, pins, etc)
4. Transient 1D heat conduction
5. Steady state 2D heat conduction
6. Transient 2D heat conduction.
